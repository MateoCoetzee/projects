        <section>
            <p>
                Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who 
                developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside 
                quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. 
                He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2,
                which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize 
                in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of 
                the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.
            </p>
            <p>
                The son of a salesman who later operated an electrochemical factory, Einstein was born in 
                the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship the 
                following year. Specializing in physics and mathematics, he received his academic teaching 
                diploma from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich in 1900. The following year, he 
                acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for his entire life. After initially struggling to 
                find work, from 1902 to 1909 he was employed as a patent examiner at the Swiss Patent Office 
                in Bern.
            </p>
            <p>
                Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could 
                no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his 
                special theory of relativity during his time as a patent clerk. In 1905, called his annus 
                mirabilis ('miracle year'), he published four groundbreaking papers which attracted the 
                attention of the academic world; the first paper outlined the theory of the photoelectric 
                effect, the second explained Brownian motion, the third introduced special relativity, and 
                the fourth mass–energy equivalence. That year, at the age of 26, he was awarded a PhD by the 
                University of Zurich.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although initially treated with skepticism from many in the scientific community, Einstein's 
                works gradually came to be recognised as significant advancements. He was invited to teach 
                theoretical physics at the University of Bern in 1908 and the following year moved to the 
                University of Zurich, then in 1911 to Charles University in Prague before returning to ETH 
                (the newly renamed Federal Polytechnic School) in Zürich in 1912. In 1914, he was elected to 
                the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, where he remained for 19 years. Soon after 
                publishing his work on special relativity, Einstein began working to extend the theory to 
                gravitational fields; he then published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing 
                his theory of gravitation. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and 
                quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. 
                He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, 
                the basis of the laser, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, he 
                applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power. Because 
                of his Jewish background, Einstein did not return to Germany. He settled in the United States 
                and became an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to 
                President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program 
                and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies, but 
                generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Einstein was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, until 
                his death in 1955. He published more than 300 scientific papers and more than 150 
                non-scientific works. His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word 
                "Einstein" synonymous with "genius". Eugene Wigner compared him to his contemporaries, 
                writing that "Einstein's understanding was deeper even than Jancsi von Neumann's. His mind was 
                both more penetrating and more original than von Neumann's."
            </p>

            <h2 id="1">Early life and education</h2>
            <p>
                Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 
                March 1879. His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. 
                In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded 
                Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment 
                based on direct current.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Einsteins were non-observant Ashkenazi Jews, and Albert attended a Catholic elementary 
                school in Munich, from the age of five, for three years. At the age of eight, he was 
                transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he 
                received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the German Empire 
                seven years later.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical 
                lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current 
                (DC) standard to the more efficient alternating current (AC) standard. The loss forced the 
                sale of the Munich factory. In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, 
                first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia. When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, 
                then 15, stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father 
                intended for him to pursue electrical engineering, but Einstein clashed with the authorities 
                and resented the school's regimen and teaching method. He later wrote that the spirit of 
                learning and creative thought was lost in strict rote learning. At the end of December 1894, 
                he traveled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by 
                using a doctor's note. During his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the title "On 
                the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field".
            </p>
            <p>
                Einstein always excelled at math and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical 
                level years ahead of his peers. The 12-year-old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean 
                geometry over a single summer. Einstein also independently discovered his own original proof 
                of the Pythagorean theorem at age 12. A family tutor Max Talmud says that after he had given 
                the 12-year-old Einstein a geometry textbook, after a short time "[Einstein] had worked 
                through the whole book. He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics... Soon the flight 
                of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow." His passion for geometry and 
                algebra led the 12-year-old to become convinced that nature could be understood as a 
                "mathematical structure". Einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as a 
                14-year-old he says he had "mastered integral and differential calculus".
            </p>
            <p>
                At age 13, when he had become more seriously interested in philosophy (and music), Einstein 
                was introduced to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, and Kant became his favorite philosopher, 
                his tutor stating: "At the time he was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant's 
                works, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him.". In 1895, at the 
                age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School 
                in Zürich (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH). He failed to reach the 
                required standard in the general part of the examination, but obtained exceptional grades 
                in physics and mathematics. On the advice of the principal of the polytechnic school, he 
                attended the Argovian cantonal school (gymnasium) in Aarau, Switzerland, in 1895 and 1896 to 
                complete his secondary schooling. While lodging with the family of professor Jost Winteler, 
                he fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie. Albert's sister Maja later married Winteler's
                son Paul. In January 1896, with his father's approval, Einstein renounced his citizenship in 
                the German Kingdom of Württemberg to avoid military service. In September 1896, he passed the 
                Swiss Matura with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical 
                subjects, on a scale of 1–6. At 17, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics 
                teaching diploma program at the Zürich polytechnic school. Marie Winteler, who was a year 
                older, moved to Olsberg, Switzerland, for a teaching post.
            </p>
            <p>
                Einstein's future wife, a 20-year-old Serbian named Mileva Marić, also enrolled at the 
                polytechnic school that year. She was the only woman among the six students in the 
                mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, 
                Einstein's and Marić's friendship developed into romance, and they spent countless hours 
                debating and reading books together on extra-curricular physics in which they were both 
                interested. Einstein wrote in his letters to Marić that he preferred studying alongside her. 
                In 1900, Einstein passed the exams in Maths and Physics and was awarded the Federal teaching 
                diploma. There is eyewitness evidence and several letters over many years that indicate Marić 
                might have collaborated with Einstein prior to his 1905 papers, known as the Annus Mirabilis 
                papers, and that they developed some of the concepts together during their studies, although 
                some historians of physics who have studied the issue disagree that she made any substantive 
                contributions.
            </p>

            <h2 id="2">Marriages and children</h2>
            <p>
                Early correspondence between Einstein and Marić was discovered and published in 1987 which 
                revealed that the couple had a daughter named "Lieserl", born in early 1902 in Novi Sad where 
                Marić was staying with her parents. Marić returned to Switzerland without the child, whose 
                real name and fate are unknown. The contents of Einstein's letter in September 1903 suggest 
                that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Einstein and Marić married in January 1903. In May 1904, their son Hans Albert Einstein was 
                born in Bern, Switzerland. Their son Eduard was born in Zürich in July 1910. The couple moved 
                to Berlin in April 1914, but Marić returned to Zürich with their sons after learning that 
                despite their close relationship before, Einstein's chief romantic attraction was now his 
                cousin Elsa Löwenthal; she was his first cousin maternally and second cousin paternally. 
                They divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years. As part of the divorce 
                settlement, Einstein transferred his Nobel Prize fund to Marić when he won it. Eduard had a 
                breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His mother cared for him and 
                he was also committed to asylums for several periods, finally being committed permanently 
                after her death.
            </p>
            <p>
                In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love Marie Winteler about his 
                marriage and his strong feelings for her. He wrote in 1910, while his wife was pregnant with 
                their second child: "I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as 
                only a man can be." He spoke about a "misguided love" and a "missed life" regarding his love 
                for Marie.
            </p>
            <p>
                Einstein married Elsa Löwenthal in 1919, after having a relationship with her since 1912. 
                They emigrated to the United States in 1933. Elsa was diagnosed with heart and kidney 
                problems in 1935 and died in December 1936. In 1923, Einstein fell in love with a secretary 
                named Betty Neumann, the niece of a close friend, Hans Mühsam. In a volume of letters 
                released by Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2006, Einstein described about six women, 
                including Margarete Lebach (a blonde Austrian), Estella Katzenellenbogen (the rich owner of a 
                florist business), Toni Mendel (a wealthy Jewish widow) and Ethel Michanowski (a Berlin 
                socialite), with whom he spent time and from whom he received gifts while being married to 
                Elsa. Later, after the death of his second wife Elsa, Einstein was briefly in a relationship 
                with Margarita Konenkova. Konenkova was a Russian spy who was married to the noted Russian 
                sculptor Sergei Konenkov (who created the bronze bust of Einstein at the Institute for 
                Advanced Study at Princeton).
            </p>

            <h2 id="3">Friends</h2>
            <p>
                Among Einstein's well-known friends were Michele Besso, Paul Ehrenfest, Marcel Grossmann, 
                János Plesch, Daniel Q. Posin, Maurice Solovine, Stephen Samuel Wise and Fritz Haber.

            <p>
                After graduating in 1900, Einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for a 
                teaching post. He acquired Swiss citizenship in February 1901, but for medical reasons was 
                not conscripted. With the help of Marcel Grossmann's father, he secured a job in Bern at the 
                Federal Office for Intellectual Property, the patent office, as an assistant examiner – level 
                III.
            </p>
            <p>
                Einstein evaluated patent applications for a variety of devices including a gravel sorter and 
                an electromechanical typewriter. In 1903, his position at the Swiss Patent Office became 
                permanent, although he was passed over for promotion until he "fully mastered machine 
                technology". Much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission 
                of electric signals and electrical–mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems 
                that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led Einstein to his 
                radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space 
                and time.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a few friends he had met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group in 1902, 
                self-mockingly named "The Olympia Academy", which met regularly to discuss science and 
                philosophy. Sometimes they were joined by Mileva who attentively listened but did not 
                participate. Their readings included the works of Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach, and David Hume, 
                which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook.
            </p>

            <h2 id="5">First scientific papers</h2>
            <p>
                In 1900, Einstein's paper "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen" ("Conclusions 
                from the Capillarity Phenomena") was published in the journal Annalen der Physik. On 30 April 
                1905, Einstein completed his thesis, with Alfred Kleiner, Professor of Experimental Physics, 
                serving as pro-forma advisor. As a result, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the University of 
                Zürich, with his dissertation A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions. Also in 1905, 
                which has been called Einstein's annus mirabilis (amazing year), he published four 
                groundbreaking papers, on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, 
                and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the 
                academic world, at the age of 26.
